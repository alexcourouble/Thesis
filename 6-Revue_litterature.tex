\Chapter{CRITICAL LITERATURE REVIEW}\label{sec:RevLitt}


Our research project touches upon two areas of software engineering research: \textit{mining software repositories} and \textit{software engineering expertise}. Besides these two research fields, we relied on another type of literature to conduct this research project: Git and Linux documentation. This chapter provides a critical literature review of the our two academic research areas and a description of the information available in the Linux and Git documentation, as well as how it helped us finding solutions for the problems encoutered.



\section{Mining Software Repositories}

In addition to providing a contribution platform, \ac{SCM} systems track and save large amounts of information about each changes brought to the source code. During the lifetime of the project, the \ac{SCM} acquires a large amount of data about the development of the project. Mining software repositories researchers \textit{mine} this data for their research projects. 

Software repositories are not limited to \ac{SCM}. There are other entities present in software repositories that research mine to gather information about software projects. These entities include bug tracking systems, mailing lists, source code, and issue tracking systems. Over the years, researchers have used mining software reporistories techniques that enabled them to research different topics of software engineering. \alex{cite daniel's git paper}

In the scope of our research, we used mining software repositories techniques in each different part of the project. The data used for both open source project created during this project came from mining the Linux Kernel repository. We eventually used this data for the creation of our expertise model.

One of the difficulty often encourntered by researchers in mining software repositories is the inability to link data coming from different entities of the software repository. In the case of the linux kernel, the dificulty was to link data from the mailing lists to the data from the git repository. A dificulty we addressed by creating Email2git.



\section{Software Engineering Expertise}
\label{sec:expertise_models}

Many different studies explored the concept of expertise in software engineering. the authors of two early studies, Expertise Browser \citep{mockus02} and Expertise Recommender\citep{McDonald}, expressed the importance of understanding developers' expertise level. McDonald et al. approach the topic from a problem solving percpective. Today's developers have many different resources at their disposal for the purpose of problem solving. Stack Overflow\footnote{\url{https://stackoverflow.com/}}, a programming question answer exchange, is used by developers from around the world that are lookiing for solutions for complex problems. Before Stack Overflow's creation in 2008, developers did not have easy access to a large database of solutions provided by \textit{experts} from various topics. The authors of the Expertise Recommender were seeking to solve this problem by providing an architecture capable of recommending experts for given parts of the software project, for the sake of problem solving. \citep{mockus02} approach the issue differently. They provide and expertise model to solve the issue of replacing or adding new expert to a distributed software engineering project. They argue that the tool would reduce the time lost by engineers attempting to find a new expert for their team.  


Each of these previous studies ~\citep{Bhattacharya}, ~\citep{mockus02}, ~\citep{McDonald}, and~\citep{Fritz-2007} base their measures of expertise among developers on the tacit assumption that experience is acquired through development activities, such as number of lines of code contributes or the number of commits authored. The author in \citep{Fritz-2007} examined the reliability of this assumption. Through a review of the many studies in psychology on knowledge and expertise, \citep{Fritz-2007} disovered that there was no sufficient evidence that activity does determine one's knowledge. The authors conducted a quantitative study on 19 java programmer to assess the accuracy of these finding. With this survey, they discovered that multiple activity related heuristics influenced developers' knowledge and expertise. These heurstics include authorship, role, work experience, and activity, which confirms the suitablility of the metrics used in previous work (LOC and commits).

Globally, we found that the previous studies on the topic fail to address several important activities present in software development mentioned in~\citep{Fritz-2007}. The authors emphasized the importance of the notion of history in determining knowledge. This is an issue we address in our model by including a historic dimention. Furthermore,~\citep{Fritz-2007} mention the effect of code stability to code knolwedge. The code stability aspect can be addressed by modifying our proposed historical expertise formula. 


\section{Open Source Participation}

Previous work studies developers' motivation in \ac{OSS}. In~\citep{Wu-oss}, warn that the losely organized nature of OSS development could be associated with a high turnover rate and in unexpected departures. Other work ~\citep{Rigby} studies the impact of a high turn over on the organization. The authors argue that departing developers bring the amount of knowledge they acquired during their time as a contributor. We believe that this implies that OSS projects are at risk of knoledge loss and we believe that accurate expertise modeling could assist in addressing this issue.
