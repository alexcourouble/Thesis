As software evolves, a maintainer's contributions will gradually vanish as they are being replaced by other developers' code, resulting in a slow erosion of the maintainer's footprint in the software project. Even though this maintainer's knowledge of the file did not disappear overnight, to outsiders, the maintainer and her expertise have become invisible. Through an empirical study on 5 years of Linux development history, this paper analyses this phenomenon of expertise erosion by building a 2-dimensional model of maintainer expertise involving a range of maintainer activities and involving activity data on more than one release. Using these models, we found that although many Linux maintainers' own coding footprint has regressed over time, their expertise is perpetuated through involvement in other development activities such as patch reviews and committing upstream on behalf of other developers. Considering such activities over time further improves recommendation models.
