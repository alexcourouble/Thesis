\Chapter{RESEARCH GENERAL WORKFLOW}\label{sec:Theme1}



My master research consisted of two different parallel projects. The first project consisted in a collaboration with the Linux Foundation and the second consisted of a case study of expertise evolution in the Linux Kernel.






Two sides of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item open source tools	
  \begin{itemize}
	\item srcmap
	\item email2git
	\item integrating email2git with cregit
	\item traveling to conferences, talking to linux devs/maintainers, introducing the tools and getting feedback
	\item How email2git can help us with out research 
  \end{itemize}	
\item Reseach paper 
\end{itemize}
